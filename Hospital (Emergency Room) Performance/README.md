# Hospital (Emergency Room) Performance

## Project Overview

This project analyzes patient flow, wait times, and satisfaction scores to uncover the efficiency of a hospital’s Emergency Room (ER) operations. The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks, improve patient experience, and optimize resource allocation.

## Data Insight and Business Recommendations
### 1. Reduce Waiting Time
- The average waiting time (~35 mins) is higher than the [Government emergency department timeframe](https://www.aihw.gov.au/hospitals/topics/emergency-departments/waiting-times).
- Use [triage optimazation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10890971) to seperate non-urgent case from urgent case.
- Increase staffing levels to anticipate demand surges (e.g., June, as shown in the dashboard).
- Add more staff in the Physiotherapy and Neurology departments due to consistently long waiting times.

### 2. Improve satisfaction score
- Although the Adult age group had the highest patient volume, performance was below average (low satisfaction scores and high waiting times).
- The Early Childhood age group recorded the lowest average satisfaction score.
- The Renal department had one of the shortest average waiting times but still recorded the lowest average satisfaction score.
