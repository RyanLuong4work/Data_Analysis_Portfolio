## Data Insight and Business Recommendations

### 1. Category Performance Overview

**Overperforming brands:**
- **FRESHMIST** – High profit and above-average profit margin; strong shelf space presence.
- **CLEANMATE** – Strong profitability and higher-than-average profit margins.
- **BIOBURST** & **PUREHOME** – Above-average profit despite moderate shelf space allocation.

**Underperforming brands:**
- **SPARKLEAN, MICROCLEAN, ECOPOWER, GREENGUARD** – Low profit and low margin; occupying shelf space without strong returns.
- **SUDSNOW** – Slightly below average in profit with moderate shelf space.
- **SHINEZ** – Higher price point but not translating into high profits.

**Performance variation across store clusters**
- **VALUE Cluster** – Highest total sales ($13.88M) and profit ($4.66M), largest store coverage (354 stores).
- **CORE Cluster** – Moderate sales ($11.88M) and profit ($3.92M), serving 302 stores.
- **UP Cluster** – Lowest sales ($8.73M) and profit ($2.91M), smallest store base (208 stores). Opportunity to rationalize assortment and boost profitability.

### 2. Range and Space Recommendations

- Remove underperforming products (e.g., SPARKLEAN, MICROCLEAN) to improve category profitability.
- Organize layout to group high-demand product lines together for easier navigation.
- Feature reliable, proven brands (**FRESHMIST**, **CLEANMATE**) prominently in all clusters.
- Keep competitive pricing in the VALUE cluster while promoting quality/value in CORE and UP.
- Introduce occasion-based bundles (e.g., seasonal cleaning packs) using top brands.
- Streamlining the product range might reduce consumer choice but can improve overall profitability and simplify shelf navigation.
- Allocating more space to high-margin products.
