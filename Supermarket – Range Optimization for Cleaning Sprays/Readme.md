## Data Insight and Business Recommendations

### 1. Category Performance Overview

**Overperforming brands:**
- **FRESHMIST** – Top profit despite moderate shelf space usage, low royalty and highest item average selling price.
- **CLEANMATE** – High profit and top shelf space usage, but low royalty and profit margin
- **SHINEZ** – Top 2 in loyalty, profit margin and shelf space usage brand; and have low item average selling price. **(Potential Brand)**

**Underperforming brands:**
- **SPARKLEAN, BIOBURST, ECOPOWER, PUREHOME** – Low profit and low margin; despite of occupying high shelf space usage and loyalty, they still recorded low performance.

**Performance variation across store clusters**
- **VALUE Cluster** – Highest total sales ($13.88M) and profit ($4.66M), largest store coverage (354 stores).
- **CORE Cluster** – Moderate sales ($11.88M) and profit ($3.92M), serving 302 stores.
- **UP Cluster** – Lowest total sales ($8.73M) and profit ($2.91M), smallest store base (208 stores). **Potential to overtake CORE Cluster performance if increasing number of stores**

### 2. Range and Space Recommendations

- Remove underperforming products to improve category profitability.
- Organize layout to group high-demand product lines together for easier navigation.
- Keep competitive pricing in the VALUE cluster while promoting in CORE and UP clusters.
- Introduce events promotion (e.g., Doctor Day -> 10% off all ANTI-BACTERIAL segment products) using top brands or clearance promotion (e.g., Golden Week -> 30% off all of BIOBURST brand products)
- Optimize the product range (reduce underperforming products) might reduce consumer choice but can improve overall profitability and simplify shelf navigation.
- Arrange more space to high-margin products.
